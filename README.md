# 2020-INFO226-application-project
An application that another student and myself developed together, for a uni assignment project. This is a web application that is loosely based on the university's BlackBoard system.

The application is written using javascript, HTML, CSS and AngularJS. It runs differently depending on the login credentials used - for example, when logging in as a lecturer, the application allows the lecturer to add a new course and a new assignment. They can also make changes to the courses and assignments, as well as being able to delete them. When logging in as a student, the application allows the student to view the courses they are enrolled in. They can also enroll in other courses. They may also mark their assignments as complete - by doing so, the assignment will be removed from their assignment "to-do" list. Students may also un-enroll in courses that they have previously enrolled in as well. 

For this assignment, we were required to work in Agile. Throughout the course, we created a product backlog on Trello, and updated our scrum board every week with tasks that needed to be done. As a result, we were able to successfully complete the assignment on time, to a high standard.
